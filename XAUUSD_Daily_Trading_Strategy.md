## 🔍 ICT Smart Money Concepts

### 1. Order Blocks (OB)
**Definition**: Last opposing candle before strong impulsive move

#### Bullish Order Block Criteria
- Last bearish candle before bullish impulse
- Must have significant volume
- Price should return to test this level
- Look for rejection at 50-75% of the block

#### Bearish Order Block Criteria
- Last bullish candle before bearish impulse
- High volume on the impulse move
- Price returns to test the block
- Rejection should occur quickly

**Entry Strategy**:
```
1. Wait for price to return to Order Block
2. Look for rejection candlestick patterns
3. Confirm with traditional TA (RSI, MACD)
4. Enter on break of rejection candle
5. Stop loss above/below Order Block
6. Target next liquidity level or imbalance
```

### 2. Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
**Definition**: Imbalance in price where gaps exist between candle bodies

#### Identification Rules
- Gap between candle 1 high and candle 3 low (bullish FVG)
- Gap between candle 1 low and candle 3 high (bearish FVG)
- Minimum gap size: 10 pips for XAUUSD
- Higher timeframe FVGs have priority

#### Trading FVG Strategy
```
Entry Setup:
1. Identify clean FVG on 15m or higher timeframe
2. Wait for price to return to 50% of FVG
3. Look for reaction at FVG level
4. Confirm with RSI divergence or Bollinger Band bounce
5. Enter on break of reaction candle
6. Target 75% FVG fill or next structure level
```

### 3. Breaker Blocks
**Definition**: Previous support that becomes resistance (or vice versa)

#### Identification
- Previous support level that gets broken
- Price moves significantly beyond the level
- On return, level acts as resistance
- Most effective on 1H and 4H timeframes

### 4. Liquidity Pools
**Definition**: Areas where stop losses accumulate (equal highs/lows)

#### Types of Liquidity
- **Buy Side Liquidity**: Above equal highs
- **Sell Side Liquidity**: Below equal lows
- **Internal Liquidity**: Within recent ranges

#### Smart Money Strategy
```
1. Identify equal highs/lows (minimum 3 touches)
2. Expect price to sweep liquidity before reversal
3. Position for reversal after liquidity grab
4. Use tight stops beyond liquidity zone
5. Target opposite liquidity or structure
```

## 📊 Traditional Technical Analysis Integration

### 1. RSI (14 Period) - Momentum Confirmation
**Bullish Signals**:
- RSI > 50 and rising
- Bullish divergence at support levels
- RSI bounce from 40-45 level in uptrend

**Bearish Signals**:
- RSI < 50 and falling
- Bearish divergence at resistance levels
- RSI rejection from 55-60 level in downtrend

**ICT Integration**:
- Use RSI to confirm Order Block reactions
- Divergence at FVG levels increases probability
- RSI overbought/oversold near liquidity pools

### 2. Bollinger Bands (20, 2.0) - Volatility and Mean Reversion
**Key Concepts**:
- **Squeeze**: Low volatility, expect breakout
- **Band Walks**: Strong trends stay near bands
- **Mean Reversion**: Expect return to middle band

**ICT Integration**:
```
- Order Blocks near BB extremes = higher probability
- FVG fills often coincide with BB mean reversion
- Bollinger Band squeeze + Order Block = powerful setup
- Use BB middle as dynamic support/resistance
```

### 3. Fibonacci Retracements - Key Levels
**Primary Levels**: 23.6%, 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%

**ICT Integration**:
- Order Blocks at Fibonacci levels = confluence
- FVGs near 61.8% or 78.6% retracements
- Fibonacci extensions for profit targets
- Use with Smart Money structure for entries

### 4. MACD (12, 26, 9) - Trend and Momentum
**Signals**:
- MACD line crossing signal line
- Histogram momentum changes
- Divergences with price action

**ICT Integration**:
- MACD momentum confirming Order Block entries
- Histogram divergence at liquidity sweeps
- Signal line crosses near institutional levels

### 5. Volume Analysis - Confirmation Tool
**Key Indicators**:
- Volume spikes at Order Blocks
- Low volume at FVG tests
- High volume on liquidity sweeps
